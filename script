1. The Awkward Introduction:
•	AI Advice: “When meeting your date, remember to make her feel comfortable. Suggest you both share something personal. Start with something vulnerable.”
•	What He Does: He awkwardly blurts out, “Hi, I’m Dave. I once cried during a commercial for soup... because it reminded me of my childhood. Do you want to talk about your deepest fears?”
•	Outcome: The woman gives him a confused look and says, “Uh… I think I’ll just have a coffee.”
2. The Overuse of Compliments:
•	AI Advice: “Compliments are a great way to build rapport. Tell her she’s the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen, but make it sound like you mean it.”
•	What He Does: He dramatically declares, “You’re... you’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. No, seriously. I’ve been alive for 34 years, and you’re number one. I’ve looked at a lot of people, but you—wow. I mean, no offense to other people.”
•	Outcome: The woman laughs nervously, unsure if it’s a joke or if he’s genuinely insane.
3. The Unwanted Deep Dive into ‘Shared Interests’:
•	AI Advice: “Find common ground quickly. Ask her about her hobbies, but be very specific. Ask her if she likes the exact same obscure things you like.”
•	What He Does: He turns to her and asks, “So, do you, by chance, enjoy vintage clock collecting, specifically clocks from the 1950s? I’ve been really into them lately. They have this particular ticking sound that, like, just hits different, you know?”
•	Outcome: She smiles politely, “Uh, no, I don’t really collect clocks.” Dave, undeterred, goes on, “That’s fine. How about extreme ironing? You ever done that? It’s this sport where you iron clothes in the most dangerous places. I’m really into it.”
4. The Question That Kills the Mood:
•	AI Advice: “Make the conversation interesting by asking thought-provoking questions. Something that will make her feel emotionally engaged.”
•	What He Does: “If you had to choose between being stuck in an elevator for a week with no food or being eaten alive by a pack of wolves, which one would you pick?”
•	Outcome: She just stares at him, horrified. “What kind of question is that? You know, I think I need to go.”
5. The Disastrous ‘Personal’ Share:
•	AI Advice: “At some point, share something meaningful about yourself to show you’re open. It’ll help deepen the connection.”
•	What He Does: “I’m really into self-improvement. I’m currently working on my ‘spiritual awakening.’ Last night, I meditated in a mirror for 10 hours to really look inside myself. It was... eye-opening. But also a little scary. Have you ever done that? Looked at your reflection for 10 hours straight?”
•	Outcome: She gives him a horrified look, then gently excuses herself to “use the restroom” and never returns.
6. The Unstoppable AI Advice Keeps Piling On:
•	AI Advice: “Don’t let her leave without committing to a second date. It’s critical to maintain momentum.”
•	What He Does: As she’s halfway out the door, he shouts, “Before you go, I just wanted to ask: Can we make this a regular thing? Like, every Thursday night at 7 PM? I’ll even schedule it on your calendar if you want! We could be like, date buddies! What do you think?”
•	Outcome: The woman bolts out the door, leaving Dave standing in the middle of the restaurant holding his phone up to his ear, confused.
7. The AI Won’t Turn Off:
•	What Happens: Dave, realizing he’s ruined the date beyond repair, starts trying to turn the AI off, but it won’t stop. It keeps suggesting things like, “Maybe you should tell her you’ve already bought matching outfits for your future children,” or “Ask her about her stance on existential philosophy.” The AI is now uncontrollable, bombarding him with increasingly weird suggestions.
•	Outcome: Dave runs outside to find the woman, but the AI keeps giving him insane instructions, like telling her he’s a professional magician and offering to perform a card trick. The AI doesn’t understand why she’s not impressed, and Dave is now a man on the verge of a mental breakdown.

Final Scene:
•	Dave, sitting alone in the restaurant, holds the phone up to his ear as it continues to give ridiculous advice. "Did you know most humans like to eat food during a date? I recommend you suggest a light salad with no dressing for her." His facial expression goes from frustration to resignation as the screen fades to black.
